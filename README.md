Migration of Invasive Aquatic Species in MN
Minnesota is home to over 11,000 lakes, over 6,500 rivers, and over 10 million acres of wetlands. Water is in our DNA, but unfortunately, invasive species are in our waters.

Data and Delivery!
We captured our data from the MN DNR website: https://www.dnr.state.mn.us/invasives/ais/infested.html
Input the data into a MongoDB database
Extracted the data from the database using a python powered Flask API
Used HTML/CSS to create the webpage
Line Chart: Shows how many lakes are infested
Map: GJSON marker cluster with pop ups and more detail
Bar Chart: How much the species has spread


Conclusions
Dominant Groups By Type:  Fishes >  Plants > Mollusks Gastropods  > Crayfish > Mollusks-Cladocerans 
Least found: Reptiles Crocodilians

Top Invasive Species:
#1 Zebra Mussels
#2 Eurasian Millfoil

Heavier Population Densities Do not equate to more Invasive Species Numbers 
#1 OtterTail County - 60k - 79 Invasive Species Present
#2 Crow Wing - 66k - 76 Invasive Species Present
#3 Douglas - 39k - 54 Invasive Species Present
# Hennepin - 1.28 Million - 28 invasive Species Present
